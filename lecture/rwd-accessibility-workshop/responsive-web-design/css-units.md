# CSS Units

- **Absolute units** are units that have a fixed size such as pixels(`px`)
  - There are others, like `cm`, `mm`, `pt`, and `in`, but these should really only be used for a document you're intending to print.
- **Percentages**, which we mainly use for widths
  - Relative to the parent element, unless we're using it on height, which is a little more difficult.
- **Relative Units**, which can be relative to either:
  1. *font-size* - `em` and `rem`
  2. *viewport* - `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, and `vmax`
