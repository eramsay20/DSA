# Media Queries

Media queries are conditions that must be met in order to apply a certain style to our page. This allows us to create layouts for mobile, tablet, desktop, etc...

Media queries are highly supported amongst all of the major browsers.

There are options for older browsers as well if you get stuck with that burden:

- [css3-mediaqueries-js](https://github.com/heathcliff/css3-mediaqueries-js) - Just include the script in your HTML file and you're good to go.

There are packages that help incorporate media queries for your, such as Material-UIs breakpoints, but it's important to know the underlying foundation and having the ability to control the finest details of your app.
